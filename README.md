# Rise of Kingdoms OCR Tools

### 📌 [RoK Monster OCR (golang)](https://github.com/xor22h/rok-monster-ocr-golang)

🌞 It brings me great pleasure to announce the `golang` [fork](https://github.com/xor22h/rok-monster-ocr-golang) by [xor22h](https://github.com/xor22h) will be the official supported OCR client of the RoK Monster community. You can expect a vastly improved experience on nearly all existing RoK Monster features while greatly increasing usability.

🥰 Thank you everyone for all the help and suggestions as we put the `php` version of RoK Monster to rest. I look forward to our community's next chapter.

## Kingdom Statistics

Command line tools to help collect player statistics from [Rise of Kingdoms](https://rok.lilithgames.com/en). By analyzing screenshots we can extract various data points such as governor power, deaths, kills and more. This can help with various kingdom statistics or fairly distributing [KvK](https://rok.guide/the-lost-kingdom-kvk/) rewards.

![Sample](https://carmelosantana.com/app/uploads/2020/11/rok-monster-cli-v0.2.0.png)

*Results may vary.*

### Features

- Character recognition by [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)
- Fast hash based image comparison
- Live results with adb

### Limitations

- Best results with a 16:9 image at 1920*1080.
- English language is preferred as coordinate information lines up most accurately with English.

## Process

Below is a quick overview of the actions performed while executing the job `governor-more-info-kills`.

1. **rok-monster-ocr** will iterate through each screenshot and compare the input image to a known fingerprint of the image containing data to capture.
2. If a match is made the image is prepared per the instructions declared in the OCR profile. *Each cropped segment represents a single data point.*
   - This process is repeated for each image in the `input_path`.
3. By default on completion a table is printed via CLI and a CSV file is saved in the current working directory.

> 📌 Input path can be defined in `.env` file or via CLI argument `--input_path`.

## Install

### Official Support

- Ubuntu 20.04.2

### Automated

One line install.

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carmelosantana/rok-monster-ocr/master/install.sh | bash -s y
```

This will install all necessary dependencies and start a small demo project.

---

Alternatively you can clone the repository and review the install script before executing.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carmelosantana/rok-monster-ocr/
cd rok-monster-ocr
sudo bash install.sh
```

### Manual

Requirements:

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php)
  - GD extension
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/)
- [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)
  - [Tessdata](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata)
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) *(Optional, only required for processing video)*

#### Software

This assumes you already have [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php) installed with access to [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```bash
sudo apt install imagemagick ffmpeg tesseract-ocr
```

*This does not represent the complete install instructions for all dependencies. Please review the [install script](https://github.com/carmelosantana/rok-monster-ocr/blob/master/install.sh) for detailed installation instructions.*

#### Tessdata

Using [tessdata](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata) or [tessdata_best](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata_best) models from the [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr) repositories have produced better results than the models provided by `apt-get`. You can download select languages or clone the repository and set this path with in the `.env` file or via CLI argument `--tessdata`.

Alternatively you can install via `apt-get`. Some issues may include:

- Incorrect user permissions
- Models don't work with legacy engine
- Can be less accurate

```bash
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr-all
```

#### rok-monster-ocr

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carmelosantana/rok-monster-ocr
cd rok-monster-ocr
composer install
```

2. Move all images to your "Input Path" as defined in your `.env` file or via CLI argument `--input_path`.
    >*By default a "Media" folder is created in your current working directory if no directory is supplied.*
3. Run job:

    ```bash
    php rok.php --job=governor-more-info-kills --input_path=DIR_WITH_SCREENSHOTS
    ```

    | Value                      | Description                                     |
